**NOTICE**

This directory includes WAMIT output files for hydrostatics, radiation, and both first- and second-order wave excitation.  The first-order excitation file (.3 extension) supports all wave headings, whereas the second-order excitation files (.12d and .12s extensions) are only provided for the 0-degree incident wave heading.  The HydroDyn flags, WvDiffQTF and WvSumQTF, can be used to activate or deactivate the inclusion of the second-order effects files, depending on the desired wave loading.
